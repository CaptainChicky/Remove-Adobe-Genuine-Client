# DISCLAIMER!!!
<sub>Unfortunately, since this could actually get me into legal trouble, I have to include this at the top :/<sub>

Everything here in this repository is for ***educational purposes only***, with the usage of such tools ***only*** intended for ***testing*** software, or for the *removal of an user's inconvenience* regarding ***mistaken*** popups on their ***genuine*** Adobe software. I do **NOT** enourage people to pirate Adobe software, or of the like. As a matter of fact, **NEVER** use this as a way to remove the genuine client on pirated software, as a way to illegally remove inconveniences on *illegal* software. Buy the license!

The only reason to use this script is when you have *genuine* Adobe software, but are still recieving "non-genuine" software popups from the genuine client, and *have exhausted all other means of removing such inconvenience*, ***including, but is not limited to***:

1) Adobe community forums
2) Calling Adobe support
3) Seeking help via third-party forums

, amongst others.

# Overview...
In this repository, you can find scripts that will remove the Adobe Genuine Client from *genuine* Adobe software, after the user has exhausted all means of removing the mistaken popup from the Genuine Client, listed above.

There are two scripts. One is named "Delete Adobe Genuine Service Popup.cmd", and this is a slow-going guide, which will help notify the user every single step that will happen. Then there is the file "Delete Adobe Genuine Service Popup without prompt.cmd" that will immediately start and finish deleting all files given in the guide script, to avoid consuming too much time during subsequent uses.

**Important note**: If a file, service, or folder doesn't exist, the script will output an error. This is completely normal, so do not be alarmed, and continue to proceed, as the errors will cause no problems.

# Closing...
Have fun with removing the Adobe Genuine Client either *for educational purposes*, or *for convenience **in genuine software**, after **exhausting all other means** of dealing with a* **false popup** originating from the Genuine Client ðŸ˜›!
